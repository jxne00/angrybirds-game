# AngryBirds Game

A simple Angry Birds game made using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) Javascript library. To win the game, simply knock all the boxes off the screen within 60 seconds. You lose if the timer runs out, or if you use up all 5 of your "birds".

Pro tip: press `b` to spawn more "birds", and `r` to reset the bird (and lose a heart).
